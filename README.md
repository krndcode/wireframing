# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a user interface. It outlines the placement of elements on a page without focusing on colors, graphics, or detailed design.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- **Clarifies Ideas**: Helps designers and stakeholders visualize the layout before development.  
- **Saves Time and Costs**: Identifies potential issues early, reducing rework later in the process.  
- **Improves Communication**: Provides a common reference point for designers, developers, and clients.  
- **Focuses on User Experience**: Ensures the structure is user-friendly before adding visual details.  

Wireframing is an essential first step in UI/UX design, helping transform ideas into structured, testable concepts.
