# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a user interface. It outlines the placement of elements on a page without focusing on colors, graphics, or detailed design.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- **Clarifies Ideas**: Helps designers and stakeholders visualize the layout before development.  
- **Saves Time and Costs**: Identifies potential issues early, reducing rework later in the process.  
- **Improves Communication**: Provides a common reference point for designers, developers, and clients.  
- **Focuses on User Experience**: Ensures the structure is user-friendly before adding visual details.  

Wireframing is an essential first step in UI/UX design, helping transform ideas into structured, testable concepts.


# Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes typically include a few essential elements that help structure the user interface before detailed design begins. These elements focus on usability, clarity, and how users will interact with the system.

### 1. Layout Structure
Defines the overall arrangement of elements on the page, such as headers, sidebars, and footers.  
**Example:** A booking website may use a two-column layout, with the left side for navigation and the right side for booking details.

### 2. Navigation
Represents how users move through the system (menus, tabs, buttons, or links).  
**Example:** A navigation bar at the top with links to “Home,” “Bookings,” “Payments,” and “Profile” helps users access different features easily.

### 3. Content Placement
Shows where text, images, and other media will appear. It focuses on hierarchy and readability.  
**Example:** On a landing page, the title and call-to-action button are placed prominently at the top, while supporting content appears below.

### 4. Functionality
Indicates interactive elements and system behaviors, such as forms, search bars, or buttons.  
**Example:** A “Search for Tickets” form box in a booking system wireframe highlights how users can start the booking process.
