# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a user interface. It outlines the placement of elements on a page without focusing on colors, graphics, or detailed design.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- **Clarifies Ideas**: Helps designers and stakeholders visualize the layout before development.  
- **Saves Time and Costs**: Identifies potential issues early, reducing rework later in the process.  
- **Improves Communication**: Provides a common reference point for designers, developers, and clients.  
- **Focuses on User Experience**: Ensures the structure is user-friendly before adding visual details.  

Wireframing is an essential first step in UI/UX design, helping transform ideas into structured, testable concepts.


# Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes typically include a few essential elements that help structure the user interface before detailed design begins. These elements focus on usability, clarity, and how users will interact with the system.

### 1. Layout Structure
Defines the overall arrangement of elements on the page, such as headers, sidebars, and footers.  
**Example:** A booking website may use a two-column layout, with the left side for navigation and the right side for booking details.

### 2. Navigation
Represents how users move through the system (menus, tabs, buttons, or links).  
**Example:** A navigation bar at the top with links to “Home,” “Bookings,” “Payments,” and “Profile” helps users access different features easily.

### 3. Content Placement
Shows where text, images, and other media will appear. It focuses on hierarchy and readability.  
**Example:** On a landing page, the title and call-to-action button are placed prominently at the top, while supporting content appears below.

### 4. Functionality
Indicates interactive elements and system behaviors, such as forms, search bars, or buttons.  
**Example:** A “Search for Tickets” form box in a booking system wireframe highlights how users can start the booking process.


# Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can be categorized based on their level of detail and fidelity. The two most common types are **Low-fidelity** and **High-fidelity** wireframes.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Definition:** Simple, rough sketches (digital or hand-drawn) that outline the basic layout and structure of a page.  
- **Purpose:** Focus on *concepts* rather than design details.  
- **Usage:** Typically used in the early stages of the design process to brainstorm ideas and align stakeholders.  
- **Example:** A sketch of a booking page with boxes for navigation, search, and results, without colors or detailed styling.  

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Definition:** Detailed wireframes that closely resemble the final product in terms of layout, spacing, and even typography.  
- **Purpose:** Provide clarity on functionality, user interactions, and visual hierarchy.  
- **Usage:** Used later in the design process, often just before moving into prototyping or UI design.  
- **Example:** A booking system wireframe that includes actual field labels, button placements, and sample text.

## What Type of Wireframe is Here?

The examples in this repository focus on **low-fidelity wireframes**, as the goal is to demonstrate the structure and key elements of a design rather than the final visual details. Low-fidelity wireframes are best at this stage because they encourage quick iterations and feedback without spending too much time on styling.


# Popular Wireframing Tools

There are several tools available to create wireframes, ranging from simple sketching apps to advanced design platforms. These tools help designers collaborate, visualize ideas, and refine layouts before moving into detailed design.
